# Hawaii Okinawa Creative Arts
Welcome to our GitHub page, where we will be documenting our progress and milestones! We are building this website for the Hawaii Okinawa Creative Arts to help bring all the information in a coherent location for viewing and to spread how Hawaii is continuing to preserve and perpetuate the Okinawan lion (Shishimai). This project is being overseen by Co-Founders/Co-Presidents Mr. Jon Itomura and Mr. Eric Nitta. 

The prpject is being developed using full stack meteror which is a javascript framework. 

## Overview
Our current project is to design and create a website for HOCA. HOCA is a member of Hawaii United Okinawa Association. At the time writing, the project is still in its planning phase.
