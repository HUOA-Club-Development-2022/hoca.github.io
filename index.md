# Hawaii Okinawa Creative Arts
Welcome to our GitHub page, where we will be documenting our progress and milestones! We are building this website for the Hawaii Okinawa Creative Arts to help bring all the information in a coherent location for viewing and to spread how Hawaii is continuing to preserve and perpetuate the Okinawan lion (Shishimai) along with performing arts. This project is being overseen by Co-Founders/Co-Presidents Mr. Jon Itomura and Mr. Eric Nitta.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Document model for backend
